Intuition
a dictionary or Counter to count occurrences. That works, but it uses extra space, so it’s not allowed here.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

**Code**
```
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        result = 0
        for num in nums:
            result ^= num
        return result
```
