Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:


 

Example 1:

Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
Example 2:

Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]
Example 3:

Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]
 

Constraints:

0 <= rowIndex <= 33
 

Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?

**Solutions**

Intuition
Input: rowIndex = 3 → Output: [1, 3, 3, 1]

Input: rowIndex = 0 → [1]

Approach
Complexity
Time complexity: O(rowIndex²)
Space complexity: O(rowIndex)

Code
```
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex):
        row = [1] * (rowIndex + 1)
        for i in range(2, rowIndex + 1):
            for j in range(i - 1, 0, -1):
                row[j] += row[j - 1]
        return row
```
