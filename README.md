A structured collection of **LeetCode solutions** written in Python, each with explanations, time and space complexity analysis, and clean code.  
This repository serves as a personal reference and learning archive for common **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** patterns.

## About the Repository

Each problem is stored as a separate `.md` file named after its LeetCode problem number and title.  
Inside each file, you’ll find:

-  **Problem statement summary**  
-  **Intuitive explanation** of the solution  
-  **Python code** with comments  
-  **Time and space complexity analysis**

This makes it easy to revisit and revise concepts quickly.
